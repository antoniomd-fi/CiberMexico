# CiberMexico
This is a demo project to use AR & geolocation

The general idea is an app to share some knoledge to the users. With the GPS the app will show you an element to a ancient culture who lived in this place and show you some info about that.
In this demo stage, I used some free models whit its respective credits.

Here's twice tests in this stage

- When the app don't find a strategic place just you can see a virtual room whit differents ancient murals
